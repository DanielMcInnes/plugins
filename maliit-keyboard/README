Maliit Keyboard
===============

This is a C++ based reference plugin. It focuses on good performance and decent
usability.


Known issues
============

On multi-screen setups, Qt's QDesktopWidget will not always report the invidual
screen sizes, but instead only report the full virtual screen size. Since this
information is used to position the virtual keyboard, it can somtimes lead to
the virtual keyboard ending up in weird places. To workaround this issue, try
swapping the monitor layout.
