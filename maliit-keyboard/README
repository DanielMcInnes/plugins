Known issues
============

On multi-screen setups, Qt's QDesktopWidget will not always report the invidual
screen sizes, but instead only report the full virtual screen size. Since this
information is used to position the virtual keyboard, it can somtimes lead to
the virtual keyboard ending up in weird places. To workaround this issue, a
settings key can be set. On Linux, the virtual keyboard's settings are usually
located in $HOME/.config/maliit.org/vkb. It might look like this:

  [General]
  _anchor=@Point(960 1080)

Remove the leading underscore from the anchor key and adjust the settings to
point at the center bottom of your preferred screen. The virtual keyboard will
anchor itself to it.
