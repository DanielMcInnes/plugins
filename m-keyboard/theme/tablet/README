For Tablet form factors, use the base theme (CSS + SVG) from parent directory
and override with a device-specific CSS where needed. Most of the time, it's
required to adjust the fixed-size layouts, especially for portrait mode.

The override CSS is supposed to be installed in the "meego" theme directory,
not "base". This implies that the device runs the "meego" theme, too.
