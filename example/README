    MeeGo Keyboard Examples
    -----------------------

This directory contains examples for MeeGo Keyboard.

    Activating a Custom Layout
    --------------------------

1. Copy the XML layout file to layouts directory:
  /usr/share/meegotouch/virtual-keyboard/layouts/ 

2. Save the list of currently enabled layouts somewhere:
  gconftool-2 -R /meegotouch/inputmethods/onscreen/enabled
  gconftool-2 -R /meegotouch/inputmethods/onscreen/active

3. Configure custom layout to be used by MeeGo Keyboard, e.g.:

  gconftool-2 --type list --list-type string \
    -s /meegotouch/inputmethods/onscreen/enabled \
    [libmeego-keyboard.so, example_layout.xml]

  gconftool-2 --type list --list-type string \
    -s /meegotouch/inputmethods/onscreen/active \
    [libmeego-keyboard.so, example_layout.xml]

4. After test driving, restore old layout configuration (see steps 2 and 3).


   en_gb_halfqwerty.xml
   --------------------

Demonstrates a "half qwerty" keyboard where each button cycles through two
candidates  for a button. This mode is available in portrait orientation and
is an adaptation of en_gb with just changed to use cycling.

Note: currently exposes some bugs in the keyboard that just haven't been
addressed yet for this mode:
 - No caps support for cyclable keys, instead the label gets inserted 
   with caps on.
 - Keys only cycle, cannot be used through error correction engine this way.
 - Magnifier not working with cycle keys

Also the keyboard layout is not optimal as the number of buttons in a row is
not divisible by two, so some extra buttons without cycling are present.
Either the space is not optimally used because buttons are using one size for all.


   en_gb_multirow_extkeys.xml
   --------------------------

Demonstrates extended keys popups with multiple rows. Allows to fit mini
keyboard sections into one key, such as key pads.

Check a, . and spacebar; trigger extended keys through long-press.
