   en_gb_halfqwerty.xml
   --------------------

Demonstrates a "half qwerty" keyboard where each button cycles through two
candidates  for a button. This mode is available in portrait orientation and
is an adaptation of en_gb with just changed to use cycling.

Note: currently exposes some bugs in the keyboard that just haven't been
addressed yet for this mode:
 - No caps support for cyclable keys, instead the label gets inserted 
   with caps on.
 - Keys only cycle, cannot be used through error correction engine this way.
 - Magnifier not working with cycle keys

Also the keyboard layout is not optimal as the number of buttons in a row is
not divisible by two, so some extra buttons without cycling are present.
Either the space is not optimally used because buttons are using one size for all.

Usage: copy the xml file to layouts directory
  /usr/share/meegotouch/virtual-keyboard/layouts/ 
and configure it to be used, e.g.
  gconftool-2 --type list --list-type string \
   -s /meegotouch/inputmethods/virtualkeyboard/layouts \
   [en_gb_halfqwerty.xml,someotherlayouts]
